        <h1>Pig Dice Game</h1>
      </div>
      <p>Hello! Would you like to play a game of Pig Dice? The rules are simple.<p>
      <p>Rules:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>This is a 2 player game</li>
        <li>On a player's turn, they roll a die</li>
        <li>If they roll a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn</li>
        <li>If the roll is anything else, the player adds it to their turn total</li>
        <li>They have 2 choices at this point:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>"Hold", which means their turn total is added to their score and the turn passes to the next player</li>
          <li>Roll again. If they have points in their turn total and roll a 1, they forfeit those points (cannot be added to score) and pass their turn to the next player. Repeat above steps.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>The game is won when a player has a score of 100</li>
      </ul>
